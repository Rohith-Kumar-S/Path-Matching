# Path-Matching
Multi-Source Multi-Target Pathfinding with Bipartite Matching

An interactive visualization tool for solving optimal assignment problems using shortest path algorithms and bipartite matching. This project demonstrates the integration of pathfinding algorithms with assignment optimization, applicable to real-world scenarios like ride-sharing, delivery routing, and emergency vehicle dispatch.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Graph Generation**
  - When the user runs the application, a graph is generated.
  - The graph is based on 8-directional grids from the selected obstacle map.
  - Each node/block in the grid is connected to its neighboring nodes.
  - Neighboring nodes are connected only if they are not obstacles.
  
- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search (with multiple heuristics)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)

- **Bipartite Matching Methods**
  - Hungarian Algorithm (Linear Programming via SciPy)
  - Greedy Algorithm (nearest-available assignment)

- **Interactive Grid Interface**
  - Customizable obstacle maps
  - Click-to-place sources and targets
  - Support for multiple source-target combinations
  - Real-time path visualization

- **Performance Metrics**
  - Algorithm execution time comparison
  - Path distance calculations
  - Matching quality metrics

## Algorithm Details

### Pathfinding Algorithms

#### **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- Guarantees shortest path in weighted graphs
- Explores nodes in order of distance from source
- Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)

#### **A* Search**
- Uses heuristic to guide search toward target
- Faster than Dijkstra for single target
- Heuristic options:
  - **Manhattan**: |x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ| + |y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ| 
  - **Euclidean**: ‚àö((x‚ÇÅ-x‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÅ-y‚ÇÇ)¬≤)

#### **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Optimal for unweighted graphs
- Explores level by level
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)

### Bipartite Matching

#### **Linear Programming**
- Finds globally optimal assignment
- Minimizes total distance across all assignments
- Time Complexity: O(n¬≥)

#### **Greedy Algorithm**
- Assigns each source to nearest available target
- Faster but potentially suboptimal
- Time Complexity: O(n¬≤ log n)
